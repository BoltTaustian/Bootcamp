This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(curl) #reading data from https
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```




```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



Subset for EU and 1952 and plot:
```{r}
gap <- read.csv(curl("http://bit.ly/gap_data"))
head(gap)
eu_52 <- gap %>%
  filter(continent=="Europe",year==1952)
ggplot(data=eu_52,aes(x=gdpPercap,y=lifeExp))+
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
gap <- read.csv(curl("http://bit.ly/gap_data"))
head(gap)
eu_5267 <- gap %>%
  filter(continent=="Europe",year %in% c(1952,1967))
ggplot(data=eu_5267,aes(x=gdpPercap,y=lifeExp,color = factor(year)))+
  geom_point()
```
